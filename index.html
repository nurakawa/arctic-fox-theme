Hi, I'm Nura. Thanks for stopping by! </br> </br>

I'm currently working towards a Master's degree in Statistics at KU Leuven (Belgium). Previously I worked in data analysis / data science. Before that, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Statistics at UC Berkeley.  </br> </br>
		
I maintain this website to share thoughts about what I'm interested in, mainly related to Statistics, Machine Learning, and R. It's a bit sparse at the moment, but stay tuned! I like to think that the best is yet to come. </br> </br>


I love to have interesting conversations. You can find me on <b><a href="https://linkedin.com/in/nurakawa">LinkedIn</a></b>.
