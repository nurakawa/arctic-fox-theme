Hi, I'm Nura. Thanks for stopping by!	<br> <br> 

<!---<img style="width: 290px; height: 290px; object-fit:cover;border-radius: 0%; padding-right:15px; padding-top:5px;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/pp.jpeg" align = "left"/> -->

I'm currently working on a Masters degree in Statistics at KU Leuven. <br><br>

Before moving to Belgium, I received a Bachelor's degree in Statistics at UC Berkeley. I have worked both in academic research and in an AdTech company. </br></br> 

<!---I am seeking a PhD position where I can work on a challenging problem in data science.
