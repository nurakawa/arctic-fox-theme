I maintain this website to share things I am passionate about, mainly related to Statistics, Data Science, and R and Python programming. It's a bit sparse, but I am working on it.

I love to discuss new ideas! Feel free to reach out on <b><a href="https://linkedin.com/in/nurakawa">LinkedIn</a></b>, or check out my <b><a href="https://github.com/nurakawa">Github</a></b> :)
