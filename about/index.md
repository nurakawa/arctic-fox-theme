Welcome! I am Nura.

I maintain this website to share some of my projects, insights and interests. 

I am currently interested in exploring the intersection of information privacy and machine learning. Specifically, <strong>I want to learn how we can develop efficient and practical algorithms for privacy-preserving machine learning.</strong>


I am always interested in discussing collaborations and new ideas, and I can be best reached by email at <b>nkawa (at) berkeley (dot) edu</b>.
