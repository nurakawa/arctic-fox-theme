I maintain this website to share my thoughts, mainly related to Statistics, Data Science, and R and Python programming. It's a bit sparse, but I am working on it.
I'm currently working towards a Master's degree in Statistics.

I love to discuss new ideas! Feel free to reach out on <b><a href="https://linkedin.com/in/nurakawa">LinkedIn</a></b>!
