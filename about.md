<p>I studied Statistics at  UC Berkeley, and I am fascinated with machine learning and large-scale data analysis. I am a huge supporter of the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R Project for Statistical Computing</a>, and I am currently working with the U.C. Berkeley Department of Environmental Engineering on an R package for predictive modeling in Geosciences.</p>
