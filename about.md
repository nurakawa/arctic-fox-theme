I studied Statistics at  UC Berkeley, and I am fascinated with machine learning and large-scale data analysis. I am a huge supporter of the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R Project for Statistical Computing</a>, and I am currently working with the U.C. Berkeley Department of Environmental Engineering on an R package for predictive modeling in Geosciences.

I maintain this website to share some of my projects, insights and interests. I am always <a href="/contact/">open to conversations</a> about ideas and collaborations!<br>
